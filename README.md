## Caladonis

This is Caladonis, a workout-logging site I wrote to expand my coding knowledge as well as to further indulge myself in a relatively new hobby of mine, weightlifting.

After my [Trimet App](https://trimet.alexperez.ninja) I wanted to create something more complicated that also included a backend. I began using Python for some side projects, so I wrote the backend for Caladonis in Django.

Caladonis is still very much a new project, but any recommendations for improvement are more than welcome by creating an issue or emailing me at [alex@alexperez.ninja](mailto:alex@alexperez.ninja).
